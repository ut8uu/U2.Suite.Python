Country files README
====================

The country file set for CQRLOG is distributed in a tar.gz archive with an
unique name, ie. cqrlog-cty120812.tar.gz. The number (here 120812) denotes
version number which is the same as the  release date.

Contents of the country file set (8 files):

AreaOK1RR.tbl (a file containing call areas, provinces, districts etc.)
CallResolution.tbl (a file containing call exceptions)
Country.tab (the main country list)
CountryDel.tab (a list of deleted countries)
iota.tbl (the IOTA list)
Exceptions.tbl (a list of two-character appendices which should be ignored,
     ie. DL1ABC/LH is still Germany, not Norway)
Ambiguous.tbl (a list of ambiguous prefixes)
README (this file)

Since version 0.4.0 (2008-06-21) CQRLOG has an auto update option which provides
date/version country file check at the program startup. We recommend to enable
this option (Preferences -> Program). If your CQRLOG tends to perform repetitive
update on every startup, please check timestamp of this files in /ctyfiles
directory:

CallResolution.tbl
Country.tab
AreaOK1RR.tbl

Try to delete file cqrlog-cty.tar.gz from ctyfiles directory, run CQRLOG again
and confirm auto upgrade. It should help. You can also move all files from the
'ctyfiles' folder to another directory and run CQRLOG again. Allow to perform
the update cycle, CQRLOG should then run as usual.

The geographic coordinates using the WGS 84 (World Geodetic System). A Decimal
Notation is used, NOT (!!!) minutes/seconds!

NOTES:
=====
There are several operations which are not accepted for DXCC. Along with known
'ungood' ones there are stations permanently or very frequently operating aboard
a ship (ship museums, they using very usual call signs like K2AA or DF0MV).
Other known not accepted ones are operations from drifting ice, artic ski
expeditions and similar event stations. Its 'bad' DXCC status cannot be easily
verified, anyway such stations are not from rare countries so we expect (and
recommend) to use another station for an award application.

Manual country files update
===========================

1. Unpack and copy all files into the /home/~/.config/cqrlog/ctyfiles folder.
The purpose of this folder is to store the files only, it is not bound to the
CQRLOG and does not affect its function.

2. Start the CQRLOG and select the 'Show QSO list' from the 'File' item in the
main menu. You can go there also using shortcut Ctrl-O.

3. If you are already in the QSO list, go there to menu. Click the 'File' item,
then the 'Import' option. Choose the DXCC data option, located at lowest
position. A dialog appears, navigate to your /home/~/.config/cqrlog/ctyfiles
folder. Click the 'Open' button. All files are read and if the import completes,
a small window with the progress bar disappears. The update is finished.

Note:
=====
While opening your new country files [see 3.], you dont need to open a
particular files. The 'Open' button starts a procedure which reads ALL files in
the /ctyfiles folder.

Important:
==========

Don't attempt to create your own country files. This can result in program crash
or incorrect statistics. If you find an incorrectly resolved station (no matter
if current log or and old record), send a not directly to me: martin@ok1rr.com.

Replace ALWAYS all files in the /ctyfiles folder! If you leave an older file and
try only a single file from the new version, the resulting tables will became
out-of-sync which ends with incorrect statistics. Also, the logger may not work
properly.

NEW LOG FILE - you can create a new log file where you can import ADIF format
QSO data. If you do this, import the most fresh country files set BEFORE any
ADIF QSO data import!

The best way is to erase all files in the /ctyfiles folder and copy the 8 files
from your new archive.

*********************************************************************
* If you update your contry files or upgrade the CQRLOG version,    *
* ALWAYS perform the 'Rebuild DXCC statistics' which is accessible  *
* from the QSO list screen.                                         *

BACKUP your data often! BACKUP your log file at the end of ANY session!
All what you need to backup and store in a safe place is the folder
/home/~/.config/cqrlog/database.
